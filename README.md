# Hey there.
#
# You nead create your own library of functions.
#
# The implementation of this challenge will help simplify your programming life and save a lot of time in future development. By creating various functions, you can understand even more deeply how they work, why and how they are used, and understand the algorithms of their work.
#
# Of course, you can use the functions from the created library in the next Track C challenges. In addition, you have a great opportunity to expand your library with even more useful functions and make it unique.
#
# Good luck, The Chosen One!
